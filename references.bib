  abstract  = "I present a new statistical method for analysing the
               relationship between two discrete characters that are measured
               across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations.
               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the
               group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two
               characters. The method takes into account information on the
               lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops
               estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and
               tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying
               upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A
               likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between
               two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for
               independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing
               for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional
               hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an
               application to the Hominoidea.",

  abstract  = "Phylogenies have emerged as central in evolutionary biology over
               the past three decades or more, and an extraordinary expansion
               in the breadth and sophistication of phylogenetic comparative
               methods has played a large role in this growth. In this chapter,
               I focus on a somewhat neglected area: the use of graphical
               methods to simultaneously represent comparative data and trees.
               As this research area is theoretically very broad, I have
               concentrated on new methods developed by me, or techniques
               devised by others and implemented by me as part of my R
               phylogenetics package, phytools. I describe a variety of methods
               in this chapter, including approaches that can be used to map
               reconstructed discrete or continuous character evolution on
               trees; techniques for projecting phylogenetic trees into
               morphospace; and methods for visualizing phylogenies in the
               context of a global or regional geographic map. In this chapter,
               my intention is not merely to showcase new methods that I have
               developed. Rather, I have also dedicated considerable attention
               to detailing the algorithms and computational techniques
               required for these approaches with the hope that this chapter
               will become a resource or jumping-off point for researchers
               interested in building new, more advanced approaches and methods

  author   = "Felsenstein, Joseph",
  abstract = "Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes,
              or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried
              out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation,
              and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods,
              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these
              conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among
              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be
              used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable
              barriers to making practical use of this technique have been
              discussed.",
